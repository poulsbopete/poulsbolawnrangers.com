<h2 class="title">A little bit about myself</h2>
<h4 class="body">In the summer of 2017... I bought my first lawnmower from my grandfather to mow my parents lawn. Now I'm expanding my business in the Poulsbo's Woods and Meadows. Summer break is right around the corner and I will have time on my hands to mow your lawn. The price is right at $20 dollars for your entire yard.</h4>

<h4 class="body">There are some things I can't offer yet but coming soon. I don't have a truck so I can't haul away your lawn clippings. Also, I have an edger but still practicing. Coming soon!</h4>
